### **Data Explanation**

**What is fMRI Time-Series Data?**

- fMRI measures brain activity over time. 
- Each region of the brain produces a time-series signal (a sequence of numbers representing activity over time).

**What is Functional Connectivity?**

- Functional connectivity measures how different brain regions "talk" to each other.
- It’s calculated by finding the correlation between the time-series signals of different brain regions.

**How Does the Model Work?**

- The model takes the functional connectivity of the brain as input.
- It predicts whether the brain activity pattern is more likely to belong to someone with ASD or a Control (healthy person).

### **Model Input**
1. **What is it?**
   - A **feature vector** derived from fMRI data.
   - Represents **functional connectivity** (how brain regions are connected).

2. **How is it prepared?**
   - fMRI time-series data → Compute correlation matrix → Flatten upper triangle into a 1D vector.

3. **Type**:
   - **Numpy array** of floats.
   - **Shape**: `(n_features,)` (e.g., `(19900,)` for 200 brain regions).

4. **Example**:
   ```python
   input_feature_vector = [0.12, 0.45, 0.78, ..., 0.34]  # Length: 19,900
   ```

### **Model Output**
1. **What is it?**
   - A **binary classification**:
     - `1` → ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder).
     - `0` → Control (Healthy).

2. **How is it generated?**
   - Input feature vector → Autoencoder → Latent features → SLP classifier → Probability score.

3. **Type**:
   - **Numpy array** of floats.
   - **Shape**: `(1,)` (a single probability score).

4. **Example**:
   ```python
   output_probability = [0.78]  # Classified as ASD
   ```

### **Summary**
- **Input**: A 1D feature vector (flattened functional connectivity matrix).
- **Output**: A probability score (ASD if > 0.5, Control if ≤ 0.5).

### **Example Code**
```python
# Input: Feature vector (flattened upper triangle of correlation matrix)
input_feature_vector = [0.12, 0.45, 0.78, ..., 0.34]  # Shape: (19900,)

# Reshape for the model
input_feature_vector = np.array(input_feature_vector).reshape(1, -1)  # Shape: (1, 19900)

# Extract latent features
latent_features = encoder.predict(input_feature_vector)  # Shape: (1, 64)

# Make prediction
prediction = slp.predict(latent_features)  # Shape: (1,)
prediction_label = "ASD" if prediction > 0.5 else "Control"
print(f"Prediction: {prediction_label}")
```

### **Key Points**
1. **Input**: Functional connectivity features (1D vector).
2. **Output**: Probability score (ASD or Control).
3. **Process**: fMRI data → Functional connectivity → Feature vector → Model → Prediction.
